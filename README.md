Linear Distribution idea -

a graphical method for observing patterns in cryptocurreny price action.

This unfinished idea came about because of the somewhat regular behaviors bots exhibit on a given cryptocurrencies' price action, volume, or other measurable metrics. 

it is though that if one can spot a pattern with these bots, it could be capitalized on.
